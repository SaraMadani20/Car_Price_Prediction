# Problem Statement
I have made this model which will predict estimated price of old car base on thier features.
As now a day we know many people are going to buy second hand car instaed of buying new one,
so its better investment option where we get almost 30-40% discount.
but main question is how will us know actual price of car base on their features so in orer to solve this problem
I have used this dataset to build model which will give a estimated price of car at which car should be sold.
